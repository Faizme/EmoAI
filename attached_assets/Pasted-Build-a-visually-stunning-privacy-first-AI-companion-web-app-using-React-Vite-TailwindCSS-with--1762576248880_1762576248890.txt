Build a visually stunning, privacy-first AI companion web app using React (Vite) + TailwindCSS with a pastel-bold 3D interactive theme.

🪩 Design & Aesthetic Goals

Use a pastel gradient palette with bold contrasts (e.g. lavender + mint + coral + sky blue).

Create a glassmorphism-inspired UI with soft glows and floating card tiles.

Use 3D depth and parallax effects (subtle shadows, hover lift, and motion).

Each tile (login, chat, reminder, profile) should look like a floating glass card with smooth transitions.

The background should feature an animated gradient + particle or wave motion (Vanta.js or Three.js).

Add scroll animations (AOS) and hover micro-interactions (scale, glow, shadow shifts).

Include a small 3D element (like a glowing heart or rotating orb) using Three.js in the chat screen.

🎨 Color Palette

Use the following pastel-yet-bold tones:

#E3FDFD (Mint Ice)

#FFE6EB (Rose Pink)

#E4FBFF (Sky Blue)

#CABBE9 (Lavender Glow)

#FFB6B9 (Soft Coral)

Accent gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #FFB6B9, #CABBE9, #E4FBFF)

These colors should feel dreamy, modern, and optimistic.

🪶 Fonts

Use “Poppins” for headings and “Inter” for body text:

Import from Google Fonts

Apply large rounded titles and high readability

🧩 UI Components

Landing Page: Welcome text, animated gradient background, 3D parallax shapes floating gently.

Login/Signup Page: Glass card with blur effect and gradient outline glow; animated form inputs.

Chat Interface: Clean bubble layout with glowing send button, typing dots animation, and floating 3D object (Three.js crystal or heart).

Reminder/Calendar Section: Soft gradient tiles with hover pop; cards slide in via AOS animation.

Settings Page: Toggle buttons for dark/light mode, animation speed, and memory retention.

🧠 Interactivity

Add parallax background using Rellax.js or CSS perspective layers.

Use AOS for scroll-in animations.

Use Vanta.js (WAVES) or Particles.js for animated backgrounds.

Smooth hover transitions with Tailwind’s transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out.

Buttons and icons should respond with glow or slight lift.
