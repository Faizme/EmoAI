✅ Vibe Journal AI — Full Project Description (Copy-Paste Ready)

Build a full-stack web app called “Vibe Journal AI”.
The app helps users reflect on their emotions daily through a conversational AI, stores a journal entry automatically, and gently improves their life with reminders and goal tracking.

🔐 Authentication + Personalization (Required)

Add Signup and Login using Flask-Login

Store hashed passwords (no plain text)

After signup, redirect user to onboarding page

Onboarding collects:

Name (required)

Age (optional)

Main goal for self-improvement (mandatory)

Save onboarding data in UserProfile table linked to user_id

If user profile exists → skip onboarding and go to chatbot page

🎨 UI/UX Style

The design theme must be:

✅ Dark Mode
✅ Premium + Elegant
✅ Neo-Noir style
✅ Subtle gradients: Deep Purple → Teal
✅ Smooth animations between pages
✅ Floating 3D shapes & parallax depth

MUST USE

Parallax scrolling on info pages

3D floating elements (Three.js or CSS 3D)

Glassmorphism cards for input boxes

Soft glows & hover animations

Page transitions: slide /fade /blur

No childish bright UI.
Should feel emotional + futuristic + safe.
