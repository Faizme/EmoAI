Decided on response conciseness strategy
Let me update the AI chatbot's instructions to make responses shorter and more concise:

Decided on chatbot response length
Perfect! ✅ Your AI chatbot now gives short, crisp responses!

📝 What Changed
I've updated your AI companion to be much more concise while still being emotionally intelligent and helpful.

Before:
Responses were 2-4 sentences
More detailed explanations
Longer, thoughtful paragraphs
After:
Maximum 1-2 sentences per response
Direct, warm, and impactful
No fluff - every word counts
Still emotionally intelligent and feeling-first
Like getting a text from a wise friend who values your time
🎯 New Communication Style
Your AI will now:

Cut straight to the point while staying warm
Deliver complete thoughts in minimal words
Keep the emotional intelligence and empathy
Provide actionable guidance without over-explaining
Sound like a concise, caring friend
✨ Example Transformation
Old style: "I hear you're feeling stressed about the exam. That's completely normal - tests can bring up a lot of anxiety. Have you tried some breathing exercises to help calm your nerves? Maybe take a quick walk before studying?"

New style: "That exam stress is real. Try a 5-minute walk or some deep breaths before you study - it'll help calm your mind."

🚀 Try It Now
Start chatting with your AI companion and you'll notice the responses are now much shorter and to the point, while still being supportive and helpful!

Your AI is ready with its new crisp, concise personality! 🎉
